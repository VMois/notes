## Reactance

Reactance is similar to resistance in that larger reactance leads to smaller currents for the same applied voltage. Further, a circuit made entirely of elements that have only reactance (and no resistance) can be treated the same way as a circuit made entirely of elements with no reactance (pure resistance). These same techniques can also be used to combine elements with reactance with elements with resistance but complex numbers are typically needed.

There are several important differences between reactance and resistance:

1. reactance changes the phase so that the current through the element is shifted by a quarter of a cycle relative to the voltage applied across the element

2. power is not dissipated in a purely reactive element but is stored instead

3. reactances can be negative so that they can 'cancel' each other out

4. the main circuit elements that have reactance (capacitors and inductors) have a frequency dependent reactance, unlike resistors which typically have the same resistance for all frequencies.
